        <h2>The Human Behind the Lens</h2>
<p>
          <a class="about__link" href="https://dave-blake.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dave Blake</a> is a 
          <strong>fashion photographer &amp; filmmaker</strong> based in <strong>Brisbane &amp; Byron Bay</strong>, but able to travel wherever your story leads.
          </p>
          <p>After more than a decade shooting <strong>models &amp; campaigns across Australia, New York, and Paris</strong>, I founded
          <strong><em>StartMyLoveEngine</em></strong> /<i>SM(I)LE</i> to focus on what started to move me: the <strong>unscripted, intimate moments</strong> — soft glances,
          quiet laughter, and golden hour promises.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are the moments that last. My background in editorial photography &amp; film production gives me the tools to create work
          that feels polished while staying deeply personal. I work hands-on with every couple from location scouting and timeline planning to custom
          film direction so that when the day arrives you can be fully present.

            <p>
              My pricing reflects a fashion industry mindset. Every project is treated as a creative commission. As a guide:
            </p>
            <ul class="about-faq__list">
              <li>Local collections begin at $3,950 AUD for 3.5 hrs of coverage, 35 edited stills, and a 5–6 min cinematic short film.</li>
              <li>International destination productions typically range from $7,000–$10,000 AUD, plus travel expenses (flights, accommodation, and ground transport), depending on the location, pre-production needs, and number of shoot days.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Every project is bespoke, shaped around your vision, your location, and what matters most to you, with pricing tailored to the scale and story of your day. Quotes are tailored and shared after our initial meeting, so we can align on your vision, location, and what matters most to capture.</p>
